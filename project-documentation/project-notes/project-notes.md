# Project discussion notes

## Virtual meeting #3

### Team theme, tentative area of interest, or question:

The Tree-mendous Smaulder Squad enjoyed meeting each other virtually before the hackathon. It seems like we have a mix of interests from forest diversity, disruptive events, to supporting software development.

## Day 1: March 12, 2024 - CU Boulder

### Selected scientific question:

How do wildfire and insect outbreaks influence the recovery of aboveground forest carbon stocks in Coloradoâ€™s high elevation, subalpine (9,000 to 11,500 feet) forests.

Rationale: Most previous research focusing on post disturbance has focused on low-elevation, ponderosa pine or mixed conifer forests. We chose to look up in elevation towards an area with less research that holds a lot of significance. Spruce fir forests store large amounts of carbon in Colorado and are susceptible to many kinds of insects and disease and wildfire risk.

Today we all resolved environment, permissions, and data access issues on cyverse. Grabbed data, filtered, and did other data pre-processing work.
