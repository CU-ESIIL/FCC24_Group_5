# Project methods overview

## Data Sources
List and describe data sources used, including links to cloud-optimized sources. Highlight permissions and compliance with data ownership guidelines.

1. [National Land Cover Database](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/national-land-cover-database) (NLCD) by the USGS, with data from 2001-2019 updated every 2 or 3 years, this is the "the definitive land cover database for the United States." We are using the "Land Cover" map product â€“ Conterminous U.S. land cover at a 30-meter spatial resolution with a 16-class legend based on a modified Anderson Level II classification system . This dataset is used to get ecosystem diagnostics.

2. [Level IV Ecoregions data](https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregions) from the EPA, who defines ecoregions as "areas where ecosystems (and the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources) are generally similar." Level IV data has a granularity of 967 ecoregions in the conterminous U.S. We use this dataset to define the Southern Rocky region.

3. [Landfire](https://www.landfire.gov/) (LF) data is used to quantify oiur disturbance type. The LF program contains 25+ geo-spatial layers, including disturbance dates and types. We are subsetting for wildfire disturbance events. This data exists from 1999-2005.
